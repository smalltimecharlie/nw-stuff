Big Data Catalog Comparison - Full Analysis with Documentation

## Unity Catalog

Unity Catalog Documentation

### Data Ownership Support

Unity Catalog supports object-level ownership where each securable object can be assigned to a principal (user or group). Ownership governs privileges and is automatically assigned to the creator unless specified. [Databricks Docs](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/ownership.html)

### Controller/Processor Roles

Unity Catalog focuses on access control lists and role-based privileges but lacks native modeling for GDPR-style data controller vs processor roles. Roles are primarily technical (e.g., users/groups).

### Retention Policy Management

Retention is enforced via underlying storage mechanisms like S3 lifecycle policies, not natively by Unity. There is no built-in time-based data retention engine. [AWS S3 Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html)

### Metadata Completeness

Unity Catalog provides comprehensive metadata for tables, views, functions, and lineage tracking across Databricks assets. It also supports tags and classifications. [Docs Overview](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html)
