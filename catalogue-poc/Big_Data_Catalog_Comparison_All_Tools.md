# Big Data Catalog Comparison - Full Analysis with Documentation

## Unity Catalog
[Unity Catalog Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html)
### Data Ownership Support
Unity Catalog supports object-level ownership where each securable object can be assigned to a principal (user or group). Ownership governs privileges and is automatically assigned to the creator unless specified. [Databricks Docs](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/ownership.html)

### Controller/Processor Roles
Unity Catalog focuses on access control lists and role-based privileges but lacks native modeling for GDPR-style data controller vs processor roles. Roles are primarily technical (e.g., users/groups).

### Retention Policy Management
Retention is enforced via underlying storage mechanisms like S3 lifecycle policies, not natively by Unity. There is no built-in time-based data retention engine. [AWS S3 Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html)

### Metadata Completeness
Unity Catalog provides comprehensive metadata for tables, views, functions, and lineage tracking across Databricks assets. It also supports tags and classifications. [Docs Overview](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html)

### AWS Datalake Integration
Unity integrates tightly with AWS via Lake Formation, S3, and IAM. Access policies can be synchronized using instance profiles or data access passthrough. [ChaosGenius Blog](https://www.chaosgenius.io/blog/databricks-unity-catalog)

### Lineage and Discovery
Lineage is captured automatically within notebooks and jobs. Users can track inputs and outputs of queries in the workspace. Databricks offers UI-based discovery of data assets. [Lineage Docs](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/lineage.html)

### Audit and Compliance
Audit logs can be captured via cloud-native logging and monitoring systems. Unity supports detailed access logs through native integration with workspace audit logs. [Audit Logs](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/audit-logs.html)

### Extensibility
Unity Catalog is a closed-source solution tightly integrated into Databricks. It does not support community plugins, schema customization, or external metadata ingestion. Extensibility is limited to Databricks APIs.

### Open Source
Unity Catalog is proprietary and not open-source.

### Ease of Deployment
Unity Catalog is built-in to Databricks workspaces and can be enabled in minutes. Set up is straightforward via UI or CLI. [Setup Guide](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html)

### Overall Fit
Unity is ideal for teams fully operating within Databricks who want a native, secure governance layer with minimal setup and tight platform integration.
